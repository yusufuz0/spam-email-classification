This project involves training a machine learning model for spam email detection using a dataset consisting of Turkish emails. The model was trained using the Logistic Regression algorithm and is designed to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails.



Project Summary

In this project, the following steps were carried out for spam email classification:

Data Cleaning: The dataset was analyzed, unnecessary columns were removed, and duplicate records were cleaned. HTML tags, URLs, and unnecessary spaces were cleaned from the email contents.

Text Preprocessing: The text data was converted into a numerical format using the TF-IDF vectorization technique.

Model Training: A classifier was trained using the Logistic Regression algorithm.

Model Evaluation: The model was tested using accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score metrics.


The model achieved an accuracy of 88.81%, effectively classifying spam emails.
